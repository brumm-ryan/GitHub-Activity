One day a boy named Billy walked from his house to school. He met his friends on the way and had a few laughs as they strolled.  Thats when a dark figure 
started chasing them down the street and into the woods.  Billy, nervously turned around and swung his backpack at the strange shadow figure.  Then all of 
a sudden it vanished into a dark mist that dissapated into the cold air.

For a while, Billy and his friends stood there. They weren't sure if what they saw was actually real, but their sweat and pumping heartbeats kept reminding them of their now-gone fear. Obviously no one will believe what they have just encoutered, so Billy and his friends decided to go to school as normal, and keep this event in their heart. That night, when Billy came home, he found his parents talking to a group of people dressed in black suits, the black color made Billy recall what happened this morning with the black shadow. Seeing Billy's appearance, one of the person from the group approached Billy, and introduced himself: "Hi Billy, I am Billy from SCP foundation"

Billy from SCP asked Billy and his friends if something strange happened, so Billy told Billy of SCP what had just happened. 
Billy from SCP told Billy that what they had just encountered was a creature that had escaped from the SCP Foundation, 
and he hoped that Billy would take him alone to the enemy where strange things had just happened. Billy hesitated, 
but SCP's Billy took out his ID to prove his identity to Billy and his family. So Billy took the SCP's Billy to the place
they had just passed by, and Billy returned soon. But none of SCP's Billy came back, and Billy told his parents that the 
other Billy had returned to the Foundation. But no one noticed the blood on Billy's trousers.
