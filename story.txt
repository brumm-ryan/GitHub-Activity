One day a boy named Billy walked from his house to school. He met his friends on the way and had a few laughs as they strolled.  Thats when a dark figure 
started chasing them down the street and into the woods.  Billy, nervously turned around and swung his backpack at the strange shadow figure.  Then all of 
a sudden it vanished into a dark mist that dissapated into the cold air.

For a while, Billy and his friends stood there. They weren't sure if what they saw was actually real, but their sweat and pumping heartbeats kept reminding them of their now-gone fear. Obviously no one will believe what they have just encoutered, so Billy and his friends decided to go to school as normal, and keep this event in their heart. That night, when Billy came home, he found his parents talking to a group of people dressed in black suits, the black color made Billy recall what happened this morning with the black shadow. Seeing Billy's appearance, one of the person from the group approached Billy, and introduced himself: "Hi Billy, I am Billy from SCP foundation"
